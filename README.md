# PaperAccurateBlockPlacement ANOTHER FORK


I forked this from this guy's fork - https://github.com/hxrry27/PaperAccurateBlockPlacement -

Used github actions to build it because I'm an idiot and it didn't work building it on my pc. 

Check the releases;  

Works and am running currently on Purpur 1.21.8-2491 & the latest version of litematica for 1.21.8

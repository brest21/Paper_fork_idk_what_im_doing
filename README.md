# PaperAccurateBlockPlacement ANOTHER FORK


I forked this from this guy's fork - https://github.com/hxrry27/PaperAccurateBlockPlacement -

Used github actions to build it because I'm an idiot and it didn't work building it on my pc. Check the Actions latest run for the plugin if you want to download it. 

Works and am running currently on Purpur 1.21.8-2491 & the latest version of litematica for 1.21.8
